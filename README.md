# cdms-products

OpenCDMS aims to provide an interface to stand-alone R packages to make them easy to use/integrate with supported CDMSs.

These R packages typically define their inputs (like DataFrames) and return outputs like DataFrames, Images etc. without managing the logic for connecting to a specific database system.

In addition to existing R packages like [Climatol](https://github.com/cran/climatol) and [CDMS.products](https://github.com/IDEMSInternational/cdms.products), this repository adds another collection of R products that are initially being developed for the Resilient Rural Belize Project. This repository may be renamed or merged with another project in the future.
